# [*]----------------------------------[ Shop configuration tutorial ]----------------------------------[*]
# Welcome to shop configuring section, the most boring part!
# Before you start creating shops, please read the instructions followed.
# (Unless you're a genius and knows how to do things already)
# We will look into the configuring with an example shop I've created as default.
#shops:
#  test: <--- This is the name of a shop, used in places such as '/token shop <name>'. A shop name must be unique!
#    title: '&6Default Shop' <--- This option is the title of the GUI displayed on the shop open. Title must be unique too, to prevent errors with other shops.
#    rows: 1 <--- This option is the rows of the shop GUI. It must be set between 1 - 6.
#    auto-close: true <--- This option decides whether the shop GUI should be automatically closed or not on purchases.
#    use-permission: false <--- This option decides whether the shop GUI should have a per-permission. If set to true, players must have 'tokenmanager.use.shop.<name>' to open the shop.
#    items:
#      '0': <--- This is the slot sets the displayed item's location in the GUI. In this case, the item will display on the first slot.
#        displayed: 276 1 name:&cGod_Sword sharpness:5 fireaspect:2 lore:&bEliminate_your|&cEnemies&b! <--- This is the item that displays on the slot. Pretty similar with Essentials' item configuring, but some item meta is unsupported.
#        cost: 10 <--- This sets the token price. Every option followed after will only execute if player have 'cost' amount of tokens.
#        subshop: yoursubshop <--- [Optional] This decides whether the plugin should open another shop named 'yoursubshop' on purchase. There must be a shop existing with the given name!
#        message: '&bTM &8» &7Thanks for your purchase, %player%! &c-10 tokens' <--- [Optional] This decides whether the plugin should send a message to the player on purchase. Use %player% placeholder to get the purchaser's name.
#        commands: <--- This is the commands executed on successful purchase. Use %player% placeholder to get the purchaser's name. Set it as '[]' if you want no commands to execute.
#        - 'give %player% 276 1 name:&cGod_Sword sharpness:5 fireaspect:2 lore:&bEliminate_your|&cEnemies&b!'
#  yoursubshop: <--- This is another shop created to test the sub-shop function. It'll open when the player purchases the item above!
#    title: '&6Default Sub Shop'
#    rows: 2
#    auto-close: false
#    use-permission: false
#    items:
#      '1': <--- In this case, this item will display on the second slot of the sub-shop GUI.
#        displayed: 373:16421 1 name:&dSPlash_Potion_of_Healing
#        cost: 5
#        commands:
#        - 'give %player% 373:16421 1 name:&dSplash_Potion_of_Healing'
