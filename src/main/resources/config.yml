  # WARNING!
  #
  # 1) Enabling this will set TokenManager's economy as your server's main economy.
  # Your old economy data will most likely RESET, and commands related to Economy
  # such as Essentials' /eco won't function as expected if target player is offline.
  #
  # 2) If you're using Essentials Economy, make sure to reset everyone's balance
  # before enabling this option! Otherwise, the old Essentials balance of the players
  # will act as the token balance.

  # /token top will be updated every x minutes. Must be higher than 0!
